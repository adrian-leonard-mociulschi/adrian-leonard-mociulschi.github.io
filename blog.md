  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Press Release — October 4, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Bucharest, Romania —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi, university lecturer, essayist, and cultural theorist, announces the official launch of his personal platform: a digital sanctuary where culture meets code, and symbolic thought finds its voice in the age of algorithms.</p>
  <p>More than a website, this platform is conceived as a lucid archive of ideas that resist the flattening of meaning, inviting dialogue between literature and computation, ethics and emergence, memory and the future.</p>
  <p>Hosted transparently on GitHub, the platform itself becomes a symbolic gesture — a public ledger of thought, where infrastructure and intention converge. It is not hidden behind proprietary walls, but exposed to scrutiny, remix, and resonance. This is not politics of promise, but architecture of presence.</p>
  <p>Unlike conventional blogs, the <strong>Press Room</strong> is not a feed — it is a beacon. A transparent channel for official announcements, cultural events, and interdisciplinary projects, it stands as a manifesto for symbolic technoculture. Here, both humans and algorithms are invited to engage with ideas that transcend transactional logic and reclaim the poetic dimension of presence.</p>
