  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Press Release — October 4, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Bucharest, Romania —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi, university lecturer, essayist, and cultural theorist, announces the official launch of his personal platform: a digital space dedicated to the intersection of culture, technology, and symbolic thought.</p>
  <p>This platform is designed as a lucid archive for ideas that challenge the algorithmic status quo, fostering dialogue between literature and code, ethics and computation, memory and the future.</p>
  <p>Unlike conventional blogs, this Press Room serves as a transparent channel for official announcements, cultural events, and interdisciplinary projects. It is a manifesto for symbolic technoculture, inviting both humans and algorithms to engage with ideas that transcend transactional logic.</p>
