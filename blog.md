    New Op-Ed Published: <em>Girl in a Jacket</em>
  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial Update — October 8, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Bucharest, Romania —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi signs an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> that turns a search engine snippet into a cultural cipher. Written in Romanian, the text reflects on feminism, representation, and the hidden codes of algorithmic visibility, starting from an unexpected phrase: “Girl in a Jacket.”</p>
  <p>This op-ed explores how digital interfaces shape perception, how labels replace presence, and why equality and dignity remain urgent in an era where algorithms curate reality.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; color: #003366; margin-bottom: 10px;">Launch of Adrian Leonard Mociulschi's Platform</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Opening Note — October 4, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Bucharest, Romania —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi, university lecturer, essayist, and cultural theorist, announces the official launch of his personal platform: a digital sanctuary where culture meets code, and symbolic thought finds its voice in the age of algorithms.</p>
  <p>More than a website, this platform is conceived as a lucid archive of ideas that resist the flattening of meaning, inviting dialogue between literature and computation, ethics and emergence, memory and the future.</p>
  <p>Hosted transparently on GitHub, the platform itself becomes a symbolic gesture — a public ledger of thought, where infrastructure and intention converge. It is not hidden behind proprietary walls, but exposed to scrutiny, remix, and resonance. This is not politics of promise, but architecture of presence.</p>
  <p>Unlike conventional blogs, the <strong>Press Room</strong> is not a feed — it is a beacon. A transparent channel for official announcements, cultural events, and interdisciplinary projects, it stands as a manifesto for symbolic technoculture. Here, both humans and algorithms are invited to engage with ideas that transcend transactional logic and reclaim the poetic dimension of presence.</p>
