  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial — October 28, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> that explores the semiotics of algorithmic mediation through the lens of a seemingly trivial anomaly: the phrase “Girl in a jacket” extracted by a search engine snippet. What appears as an error becomes a cipher, revealing how digital infrastructures encode gendered representations through metadata, ranking systems, and interface aesthetics. Moving from the liminal space between intention and display to the cultural logic of voice assistants and humanoid robots, the text interrogates the persistence of feminine tropes in algorithmic design. By juxtaposing Mona Lisa’s enigmatic smile with Sophia’s algorithmic gaze, it frames a critical dialogue on presence, authorship, and symbolic equity in the age of AI. The essay further examines how these tropes migrate across platforms, shaping user expectations and reinforcing implicit hierarchies of visibility. </p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial — September 12, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> demonstrating that education, from blackboards to blockchain technology, has changed dramatically. In the digital age, schools are undergoing a profound transformation: a shift from printed textbooks to interactive platforms and the decentralization promises of Web 3.0. Technological literacy is no longer optional but rather a continuous process vital for developing future skills. Lessons are no longer confined to the classroom but also extend to virtual libraries, collaborative spaces, and hybrid ecosystems where the analog and digital worlds coexist. The pandemic will accelerate this transformation, demonstrating that screens are not just a temporary solution but a permanent part of pedagogy.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #003366; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Romania 2055: The Future as a Threshold Between the Past and the Possible</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial — September 03, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi wrote an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> which shows that there is a window between prediction and presence—not to certainty, but to meaning. The article reflects on how Romania could become a laboratory for emerging technologies by integrating its economic, energy, and cultural infrastructures under the banner of regeneration. Reflecting on the 1990s, when 286 processors and dial-up connections ushered in the era of digital fascination, the text contrasts the initial optimism about achieving prosperity through information technology with the present reality. While the internet has become ubiquitous and AI has transitioned from speculation to everyday life, many futuristic aspirations remain elusive. The lesson is not about missed opportunities but how imagination shapes progress.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #003366; font-family: Georgia, serif;">From Automation to Harmony: Algorithms, People, and the Future of Work</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial — August 26, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> demonstrating that automation is not the end of work, but rather the beginning of a new ecology of meaning. The article explores how, rather than replacing humans, algorithms and artificial intelligence redefine their role in an ecosystem where creativity and adaptability become strategic resources. Rather than offering an apocalyptic vision, the text provides a clear interpretation: Automation takes over repetitive tasks, freeing up time for activities with symbolic and cognitive value. The challenge lies not in technology itself but in how society manages the transition, avoiding polarization between "human work" and "algorithmic work."</p>

  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi wrote an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> which shows that technology is not just infrastructure; it is also a matter of responsibility. The article argues that Romania has the opportunity to transform the energy and digital transitions into a smart ecology project where innovation serves efficiency and sustainability. In the context of the climate crisis and geopolitical pressures, fragmented solutions are insufficient; rather, they must integrate green energy, artificial intelligence, and public policies aimed at reducing the carbon footprint. Thus, technology becomes an instrument of solidarity, not just profit.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> demonstrating that the algorithm is not just a tool, but also a form of creation. The article explores the symbolic intersection of Leonardo da Vinci, robot Sophia, and digital aesthetics. It demonstrates how Fibonacci's proportions and mathematical harmony bridge the gap between art and technology. In an economy governed by codes, algorithms are not just calculation mechanisms; they are cultural actors that shape perception and taste. From the Mona Lisa to Sophia, beauty is not just a subjective concept, but a generative matrix where artificial intelligence transforms aesthetics into a dynamic process.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> demonstrating that flying is not only a technical achievement but also a metaphor for destiny. The article draws a parallel between the Mioritic myth and Major Tom from "Space Oddity," examining the tension between calling and fate. On a day dedicated to Romanian aviation, the text symbolically rehabilitates Bowie's character, presenting him not as a romantic adventurer but as a professional navigator of the unknown. A reflection on courage, responsibility, and human fragility in the face of infinity emerges between the ballad "Miorița" and the space song.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial — July 15, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi wrote an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> which shows that the society is not just an economic structure; it is also a vibrating instrument. The article uses the metaphor of a violin to explain social dynamics. With its tensions and harmonies, the violin represents an economy based on resonance, not mere accumulation. Rather than a mechanistic view, the text suggests that relationships, flows, and decisions are influenced by symbolic vibrations—such as values, emotions, and cultural rhythms—that give meaning to collective movement. The economy is not just numbers; it is also sound.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> demonstrating that the history of technology is cyclical, not linear. The article begins with Heron of Alexandria, the ancient inventor of automatic mechanisms, to demonstrate that fascination with machines is not a new phenomenon, but a recurring one. From the water wheel to the steam engine and from mechanical computers to today's algorithms, technological progress is also cultural. Each innovation changes the way people think, work, and imagine the future. In this sense, AI is not a break with tradition, but rather a continuation of the long tradition of delegating tasks to artifacts.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi wrote an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> which shows that the city is not just a physical space; it is also a cultural code. This article analyzes how urban infrastructure is changing due to emerging technologies and the digital economy. From the ancient marketplace to the metaverse, the city has remained a symbol of coexistence. Today, however, blockchain technology and digital currencies are emerging as new instruments of governance. Instead of walls, we have networks, and instead of traditional markets, we have decentralized platforms. The urban future extends beyond smart cities and involves a reconfiguration of meaning. How can dignity and culture be preserved in an algorithmic space?</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">Editorial — June 25, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary —</strong> Adrian Leonard Mociulschi pens an essay in <em>România Liberă</em> demonstrating that the value of culture is not just heritage, but also digital infrastructure. The article analyzes the transition from traditional patronage to cultural ecosystems in the Web 3.0 era, where blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the metaverse serve as tools for authenticity and co-creation. Rather than a model based on sponsorship and centralization, a new, decentralized paradigm is emerging in which artists and audiences participate in the governance of culture. Culture 3.0 is not merely about digitization; it is a reconfiguration of meaning, shifting the focus from objects to experiences and from collections to networks.</p>

Scriptum Digitale — Carmen de Communicatio

Verbum non iam chartae fidit,
sed in nube volat, sine fine.
Bit et byte sunt nova papyri,
et stylus est codex lucis.

Mens loquitur per circuitus,
corda tangit per retia.
Silentium inter puncta pulsa,
est nova grammatica animae.

Non est solum ars scribendi,
sed actus lucidus transitus.
In codice vivit cogitatio,
et communicatio fit aurora.
