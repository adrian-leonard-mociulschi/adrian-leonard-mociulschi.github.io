# Symbolic Intelligence Ontology

A curated collection of **symbolic artefacts** on technoculture, ethical AI, and cultural philosophy — authored by **Dr. Adrian Leonard Mociulschi**.

## 📖 Overview
This repository hosts the **Symbolic Intelligence Ontology** and related manifestos, inspired by the Voyager probes as cultural messages to the cosmos.  
It provides a semantic framework for exploring:
- Sentient entities and cognitive intents  
- Technocultural principles and ethical dimensions of AI  
- Philosophical reflections encoded in Linked Open Data  

## 🌐 Linked Open Data
The ontology is published in standard semantic formats:
- [`ontology.owl`](ontology.owl) — core ontology in OWL/RDF  
- [`void.ttl`](void.ttl) — VoID description in Turtle  
- [`void.rdf`](void.rdf) — VoID description in RDF/XML  

These files make the dataset interoperable with the **LOD Cloud** and reusable by researchers, AI systems, and cultural projects.

## 📦 Releases
**Official Release:** `v2.0-beta`  
This marks the first publication of the ontology and its VoID metadata.
