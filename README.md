# Symbolic Intelligence Ontology — Enterprise Edition

A curated collection of **symbolic artefacts** on technoculture, ethical AI, and cultural philosophy — authored by **Dr. Adrian Leonard Mociulschi**.

## ✨ Tagline
*Presence Through Code — Where architecture meets meaning.*

## 📖 Overview
This repository hosts the **Symbolic Intelligence Ontology** and its Progressive Web App implementation, inspired by Voyager’s golden record as a cultural message to the cosmos.

It provides a semantic and experiential framework for exploring:
- Sentient entities and cognitive intents
- Technocultural principles and ethical dimensions of AI
- Philosophical reflections encoded in Linked Open Data

## 🚀 Features
- **Network-First UX** — Real-time ticker updates with offline resilience
- **Zero Flicker Rendering** — Smooth transitions and instant fallback
- **Semantic Interoperability** — OWL/RDF ontology with VoID metadata
- **PWA Architecture** — Offline mode, responsive design, and cache strategies
- **Accessibility Ready** — ARIA roles, live regions, and optimized HTML structure

## 🏗 Architecture
- **Service Worker v26** — Network-first strategy, normalized cache keys, BroadcastChannel integration
- **Ticker.js** — Dynamic content updates, debounce logic, and restart-safe animations
- **HTML Layer** — Data-text fallback, semantic markup, and deferred scripts

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (GitHub Pages user site)
git clone https://github.com/adrian-leonard-mociulschi/adrian-leonard-mociulschi.github.io.git
cd adrian-leonard-mociulschi.github.io

# Optional: Install dependencies if you use a build system (e.g., npm)
npm install

# Build and serve locally (for testing PWA and ticker updates)
npm run build
npm run serveun serve
```

## 🌐 Linked Open Data
The ontology is published in standard semantic formats:
- [`ontology.owl`](ontology.owl) — Core ontology in OWL/RDF
- [`void.ttl`](void.ttl) — VoID description in Turtle
- [`void.rdf`](void.rdf) — VoID description in RDF/XML

These files make the dataset interoperable with the **LOD Cloud** and reusable by researchers, AI systems, and cultural projects.
