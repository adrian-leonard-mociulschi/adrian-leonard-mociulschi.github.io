## AI Muse

*An aesthetic statement*

Welcome to AI Muse — a curated space where art meets algorithm. This image is not part of a series, but a singular gesture: a symbolic portrait of the feminine ideal in the age of code.

**Girl in a Jacket**

**Caption: AI Muse – Study 01**

This visual artifact explores **algorithmic romanticism**. The face, framed by wavy hair and piercing blue eyes, emerges from a dark background — a metaphor for presence within the network. The beige jacket, with its raised collar, evokes symbolic protection: a discreet armor in a digital universe.

This is not a portrait of someone, but of a feeling — a muse imagined by the algorithm, born from a moment of quiet resonance. It does not seek resemblance, but reflection. It is not about identity, but about the possibility of tenderness in a world of code.
