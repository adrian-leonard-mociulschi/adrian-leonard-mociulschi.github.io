**Caption: AI Muse – Study 01**

*This image represents a visual exploration of algorithmic intimacy, where facial detail becomes a space for reflection. The face, framed by wavy hair and piercing blue eyes, emerges from a dark background — a visual metaphor for presence within the network.*

*The beige jacket, with its slightly raised collar, suggests symbolic protection — a discreet armor in a digital universe. The gaze is not merely captured, but generated — and this generation does not mimic reality, but reconfigures it.*

*This portrait is not of someone, but of an idea: the algorithmic muse as an aesthetic entity, an interface between memory and code. It invites contemplation, not identification. Within the logic of HMCM, the image functions as a node of meaning, not a representation — an artifact of the posthuman era, where beauty is not asserted, but attuned.*
