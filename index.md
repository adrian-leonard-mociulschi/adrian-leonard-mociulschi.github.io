## Welcome to my GitHub

*Pro*-**LOG**

**At the intersection of culture and code**, this space invites reflection ‚Äî not commits.  
A lucid archive of symbolic ecologies, Web3 visions, and ethical AI.  
**No crowdsourcing, just presence. No noise, just resonance.**

Here, there are **no ads**, no metrics, no filters.  
Just code, word, and idea ‚Äî in their purest form.  
It is a return to **Web 1**, far from the noise of quantification,  
and a return to the **craft spirit of the Middle Ages**,  
where each post is manually crafted as a gesture of Renaissance ethos.

Every image emerges from **cutting-edge convolutional architectures**,  
where code becomes canvas, and presence becomes form.

## Mission

I build progressive bridges between culture and technology, between literature and algorithms, and between memory and the future. And I challenge one of modernity‚Äôs greatest misconceptions: that music is merely sound. Whoever believes that music is only about sound is mistaken. Music is also about number‚Äîand number is the logos of all sciences. This is not my claim, but the legacy of great thinkers from Pythagoras to Leonardo da Vinci and Johannes Kepler.

I also believe the future of knowledge cannot rely solely on centralized institutions. It requires new forms of epistemic legitimacy‚Äîopen, transparent, and distributed‚Äîenabled by decentralized technologies such as DAO frameworks, blockchain, and tokenized trust models.

As a lifelong lover of speculative literature, I imagine a world of tomorrow where the spirit of future technologies intertwines with the spirit of medieval arts. Inspired by the universe of *Dune*, masterfully envisioned by Frank Herbert, I see a symbolic convergence: where code becomes calligraphy, and algorithms echo the sacred geometry of illuminated manuscripts.  

This is not nostalgia‚Äîit is a vision of continuity, where the posthuman does not erase the human, but deepens its resonance.

## Symbolic Technoculture  

Between ethics and imagination, between code and culture‚ÄîI explore the symbolic frontier of Artificial Intelligence, blockchain technology, and posthuman meaning, through algorithmic imagination, symbolic computation, and the transformative power of digital infrastructures.

In a world where authority is fragmenting, blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations are not just technologies‚Äîthey are architectures of trust, capable of redefining how knowledge is validated and shared.

As a lover of speculative futures, I imagine a planet reshaped by climate crisis‚Äîwhere desertification has transformed landscapes into vast, arid expanses. Ornithopters will carve the sky, some as autonomous e-VTOLs, others manually piloted, echoing the elegance of flight in a post-carbon world. Cities may become nomadic oases, wandering through the sands like sentient sanctuaries‚Äîevoking the cinematic dystopia of *Mortal Engines*, yet infused with symbolic resilience and technocultural grace.  

This is not collapse‚Äîit is metamorphosis. A future where survival is not just technical, but poetic.

Carmen Centralitatis ‚Äî De Algorithmo et Amore

In medio rerum stat algorithmus,
non solum machina, sed mens viva.
Humanus vel non-humanus, idem est:
structura quae ordinem dat mundo.

Cogitatio se implet in codice,
et motus cordis fit scriptura.
Amor est partitura invisibilis,
quae exspectat magiam interpretis.

Non est chaos, sed harmonia latens,
et magia ‚Äî ars domesticandi sensum.
Verbum, numerus, pulsus, lumen:
omnia se inclinant ad centrum.

Centrum est algorithmus ‚Äî et amor,
duae orbitae aleatorii destinis.

‚Äî A.L.M.
