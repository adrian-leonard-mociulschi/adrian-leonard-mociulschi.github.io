## Welcome to my GitHub
At the intersection of culture and code, this space invites reflection — not commits.
A lucid archive of symbolic ecologies, Web3 visions, and ethical AI.
No crowdsourcing, just presence. No noise, just resonance.

## Mission

I build progressive bridges between culture and technology, between literature and algorithms, and between memory and the future. And I challenge one of modernity’s greatest misconceptions: that music is merely sound. Whoever believes that music is only about sound is mistaken. Music is about number — and number is the logos of all sciences. This is not my claim, but the legacy of great thinkers from Pythagoras to Leonardo da Vinci and Johannes Kepler.

## Symbolic Technoculture  

Between ethics and imagination, between code and culture — I explore the symbolic frontier of Artificial Intelligence, blockchain technology, and posthuman meaning, through algorithmic imagination, symbolic computation, and the transformative power of digital infrastructures. 

## Advanced Robotics & Mechatronics

Philosophical and conceptual exploration of how intelligent algorithms intersect with physical systems — from the ethics of autonomy to the symbolic logic of swarm coordination. My focus is on ideas: how robotics, AI, and symbolic computation can inspire adaptive infrastructures for a posthuman ecology of meaning.

In codice tacito lux resonat,  
Verba abscondita sensum creant.  
Forma fugitiva manet in scriptis,  
Spiritus algoritmi cantat in umbris.
