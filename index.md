## Welcome to my GitHub {#top}

At the intersection of culture and code, this space invites reflection‚Äînot commits. A lucid archive of symbolic ecologies, Web3 visions, and ethical AI. No crowdsourcing, just presence. No noise, just resonance.

In this virtual space, algorithmically free, beauty is created through code, through word, through ideas.  
It is a return to Web 1 ‚Äî far from the noise of metrics, far from the opaque filtering of algorithms.  
But it is also a return to the **craft spirit of the Middle Ages**.  

Posts are created and updated manually ‚Äî not out of ignorance, but out of a desire to **recover the spirit of the Renaissance**.

## Mission

I build progressive bridges between culture and technology, between literature and algorithms, and between memory and the future. And I challenge one of modernity‚Äôs greatest misconceptions: that music is merely sound. Whoever believes that music is only about sound is mistaken. Music is also about number‚Äîand number is the logos of all sciences. This is not my claim, but the legacy of great thinkers from Pythagoras to Leonardo da Vinci and Johannes Kepler.

I also believe the future of knowledge cannot rely solely on centralized institutions. It requires new forms of epistemic legitimacy‚Äîopen, transparent, and distributed‚Äîenabled by decentralized technologies such as DAO frameworks, blockchain, and tokenized trust models.

As a lifelong lover of speculative literature, I imagine a world of tomorrow where the spirit of future technologies intertwines with the spirit of medieval arts. Inspired by the universe of *Dune*, masterfully envisioned by Frank Herbert, I see a symbolic convergence: where code becomes calligraphy, and algorithms echo the sacred geometry of illuminated manuscripts.  

This is not nostalgia‚Äîit is a vision of continuity, where the posthuman does not erase the human, but deepens its resonance.

## Symbolic Technoculture  

Between ethics and imagination, between code and culture‚ÄîI explore the symbolic frontier of Artificial Intelligence, blockchain technology, and posthuman meaning, through algorithmic imagination, symbolic computation, and the transformative power of digital infrastructures.

In a world where authority is fragmenting, blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations are not just technologies‚Äîthey are architectures of trust, capable of redefining how knowledge is validated and shared.

As a lover of speculative futures, I imagine a planet reshaped by climate crisis‚Äîwhere desertification has transformed landscapes into vast, arid expanses. Ornithopters will carve the sky, some as autonomous e-VTOLs, others manually piloted, echoing the elegance of flight in a post-carbon world. Cities may become nomadic oases, wandering through the sands like sentient sanctuaries‚Äîevoking the cinematic dystopia of *Mortal Engines*, yet infused with symbolic resilience and technocultural grace.  

This is not collapse‚Äîit is metamorphosis. A future where survival is not just technical, but poetic.
