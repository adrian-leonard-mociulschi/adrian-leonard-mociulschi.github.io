## About me

I am an academic and Romanian writer, author of a five-part series of essays published by Curtea Veche Publishing ‚Äî a constellation of ideas forming a symbolic pentagram of knowledge. My intellectual horizon is shaped by the cultural perspectives of Ren√© Berger and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as the prophetic insights of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke.

Ren√© Berger once said: *‚ÄúTechnology is not culture, but it can become culture through meaning.‚Äù* This principle inspires my mission: to create innovative connections between culture and technology, literature and algorithms, memory and the future. It is a symbolic technocultural revolution ‚Äî silent, algorithm-friendly, and meritocratic.

I advocate for **ethical** AI and a **posthuman ecology of meaning**, while continuing a family tradition rooted in over two centuries of cultural heritage in Romania ‚Äî reinterpreted for the challenges of the 21st century.

## About this website

Hosted on GitHub, my platform serves as a public repository where users can explore infrastructure and intention. Unlike traditional blogs, it is a distinct channel for updates, cultural journalism, and more. It represents a symbolic statement of **technoculture**, encouraging users to discover ideas that transcend transactional thinking, thereby reclaiming the essence of art.

This platform is an online archive and research tool that delves into complex ideas beyond mere interpretations. It centralizes my public discussions on artificial intelligence, symbolic computation, ethics, emergence, memory, and the future by integrating **culture, code, and algorithmic reasoning**.
