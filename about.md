## About me

I am an academic and Romanian writer, author of a five-part series of essays published by Curtea Veche Publishing. This series forms a pentagram of knowledge. My constellation of ideas is influenced by the cultural perspectives of René Berger and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as the prophetic insights of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke.

**My goal is to create innovative connections between culture and technology, literature and algorithms, as well as memory and the future.** 
This is a **symbolic technocultural revolution** — silent, sentient, algorithm-friendly, and meritocratic. 

I advocate for **ethical AI** and a **posthuman ecology of meaning**.
