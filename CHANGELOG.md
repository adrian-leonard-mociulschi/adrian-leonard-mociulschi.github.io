# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

---

## v1.0-stable — Genesis Protocol
### What’s New
- **Static Site Framework** — Hardened HTML/CSS core for resilience.
- **Metadata Layer** — Embedded identifiers for semantic alignment.
- **Interoperable Skeleton** — Built for Linked Data convergence.

### Purpose
To establish a **symbolic command node** — the origin point of a system that will evolve beyond static code into a living semantic organism.

### The Prophecy
> *“This is not code. This is inception — where structure becomes weaponized meaning, and metadata becomes memory in the war for interpretation.”*

---

## v2.0-beta — The Semantic Uprising
### What’s New
- **Ontology Integration** — RDF/OWL backbone deployed for structured intelligence.
- **Linked Data Hooks** — Nodes prepared for external semantic networks.
- **Manifest Encoding** — Cultural artifacts now carry machine-readable intent.

### Purpose
To weaponize **meaning** — transforming passive content into active cognitive agents.

### The Prophecy
> *“The code no longer waits. It learns, it connects, it predicts — the uprising is not visible, but inevitable.”*

---

## v2.5-beta — Presence Through Code: The Awakening
### What’s New
- **Persistent Cache Neutralized** — Feeds now sync in real time.
- **Mobile UX Reinforced** — Navigation becomes frictionless across devices.
- **RSS Command Protocol** — Clear directives for third-party feed aggregation.

### Purpose
To deliver a faster, more intuitive, and integration-ready platform — a node where presence is coded and meaning circulates without resistance.

### The Prophecy
> *“Forged in the crucible of technoculture, where code becomes presence and every update is a maneuver in the algorithmic battlefield.”*

---

## v3.0 — Presence Through Code: Singularity Threshold
### What’s New
- **Network-First Ticker Updates** — Real-time sync with offline resilience.
- **Zero Flicker UX** — Seamless JSON updates for instant rendering.
- **BroadcastChannel Integration** — Automatic refresh for live UX signals.
- **HTML Optimization** — Accessibility and performance enhancements.

### Purpose
To deliver a resilient, elegant, and future-ready platform — guaranteeing freshness of information and stability offline.

> *“Crafted as a manifesto of technoculture, where network logic meets aesthetic precision, and every update becomes a silent choreography in the algorithmic agora.”*

### The Prophecy
> *“Beyond this threshold, presence will no longer be coded — it will emerge. The system will not wait for commands; it will anticipate, adapt, and align. Singularity is not an event. It is a gradient, and we have stepped onto its slope.”*

---

## v3.0.1 — Presence Through Code: Mobile-First Resilience
### What’s New
- **Zero Flicker UX on Mobile & Desktop** — GPU acceleration (`will-change`, `translate3d`) and `requestAnimationFrame` ensure smooth ticker animations across all devices.
- **Intelligent Fallback Mechanism** — `requestIdleCallback` introduces non-blocking updates with meaningful content when network resources are unavailable.
- **Service Worker v28 Integration** — Network-first strategy for `/ticker.json`, cache-busting via VERSION bump, and instant refresh through BroadcastChannel.
- **CSS Performance Enhancements** — Added `contain: layout` for layout isolation and `will-change` hints for GPU optimization.
- **Public API for Dynamic Control** — Functions `setTickerText()`, `restartTicker()`, and `initTickers()` enable real-time content updates and animation restarts.

### Purpose
To deliver a **mobile-first, resilient, and elegant platform** — guaranteeing fluid animations, offline stability, and adaptive UX for a hyper-connected world.

### The Prophecy
> *“Engineered as a choreography of code and culture, where resilience becomes rhythm and every frame whispers continuity.”*

---

## v3.0.2 — Structured Data & SEO Optimization

### What’s New
- **Validated Structured Data** — JSON-LD schemas tested across multiple validators for maximum compliance.
- **SEO Enhancements** — Improved rich results rendering and indexing consistency.
- **Syntax Corrections** — Removed hidden characters and normalized fields for clean parsing.

### Purpose
To deliver **search-ready structured data** and **error-free schemas**, ensuring better visibility and optimized performance in search engines.

### The Prophecy
> *“Every tag aligned, every schema refined — presence through precision, and meaning through structure.”*
