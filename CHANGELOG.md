## v1.0-stable — Genesis Protocol
### What’s New
- **Static Site Framework** — Hardened HTML/CSS core for resilience.
- **Metadata Layer** — Embedded identifiers for semantic alignment.
- **Interoperable Skeleton** — Built for Linked Data convergence.

### Purpose
To establish a **symbolic command node** — the origin point of a system that will evolve beyond static code into a living semantic organism.

### The Prophecy
> *“This is not code. This is inception — where structure becomes weaponized meaning, and metadata becomes memory in the war for interpretation.”*

---

## v2.0-beta — The Semantic Uprising
### What’s New
- **Ontology Integration** — RDF/OWL backbone deployed for structured intelligence.
- **Linked Data Hooks** — Nodes prepared for external semantic networks.
- **Manifest Encoding** — Cultural artifacts now carry machine-readable intent.

### Purpose
To weaponize **meaning** — transforming passive content into active cognitive agents.

### The Prophecy
> *“The code no longer waits. It learns, it connects, it predicts — the uprising is not visible, but inevitable.”*

---

## v2.5-beta — Presence Through Code: The Awakening
### What’s New
- **Persistent Cache Neutralized** — Feeds now sync in real time.
- **Mobile UX Reinforced** — Navigation becomes frictionless across devices.
- **RSS Command Protocol** — Clear directives for third-party feed aggregation.

### Purpose
To deliver a faster, more intuitive, and integration-ready platform — a node where presence is coded and meaning circulates without resistance.

### The Prophecy
> *“Forged in the crucible of technoculture, where code becomes presence and every update is a maneuver in the algorithmic battlefield.”*

---

## v3.0 — Presence Through Code: Singularity Threshold
### What’s New
- **Network-First Ticker Updates** — Real-time sync with offline resilience.
- **Zero Flicker UX** — Seamless JSON updates for instant rendering.
- **BroadcastChannel Integration** — Automatic refresh for live UX signals.
- **HTML Optimization** — Accessibility and performance enhancements.

### Purpose
To deliver a resilient, elegant, and future-ready platform — guaranteeing freshness of information and stability offline.

### The Prophecy
> *“Beyond this threshold, presence will no longer be coded — it will emerge. The system will not wait for commands; it will anticipate, adapt, and align. Singularity is not an event. It is a gradient, and we have stepped onto its slope.”*

---

## v3.0.1 — Presence Through Code: Mobile-First Resilience
### What’s New
- **Zero Flicker UX on Mobile & Desktop** — GPU acceleration (`will-change`, `translate3d`) and `requestAnimationFrame` ensure smooth ticker animations across all devices.
- **Intelligent Fallback Mechanism** — `requestIdleCallback` introduces non-blocking updates with meaningful content when network resources are unavailable.
- **Service Worker v28 Integration** — Network-first strategy for `/ticker.json`, cache-busting via VERSION bump, and instant refresh through BroadcastChannel.
- **CSS Performance Enhancements** — Added `contain: layout` for layout isolation and `will-change` hints for GPU optimization.
- **Public API for Dynamic Control** — Functions `setTickerText()`, `restartTicker()`, and `initTickers()` enable real-time content updates and animation restarts.

### Purpose
To deliver a **mobile-first, resilient, and elegant platform** — guaranteeing fluid animations, offline stability, and adaptive UX for a hyper-connected world.

### The Prophecy
> *“Engineered as a choreography of code and culture, where resilience becomes rhythm and every frame whispers continuity.”*

---

## v3.0.2 — Structured Data & SEO Optimization

### What’s New
- **Validated Structured Data** — JSON-LD schemas tested across multiple validators for maximum compliance.
- **SEO Enhancements** — Improved rich results rendering and indexing consistency.
- **Syntax Corrections** — Removed hidden characters and normalized fields for clean parsing.

### Purpose
To deliver **search-ready structured data** and **error-free schemas**, ensuring better visibility and optimized performance in search engines.

### The Prophecy
> *“Every tag aligned, every schema refined — presence through precision, and meaning through structure.”*

---

## v3.0.3 — Ticker Performance & Dynamic Control

### What’s New
This version introduces **major improvements for ticker animation performance and flexibility**, ensuring smooth rendering across all devices (including macOS) and enabling dynamic speed control via JavaScript.

### ✅ Highlights
- **GPU-Accelerated Animation** — Implemented `transform: translateX` with `will-change` and `translateZ(0)` for flawless compositing.
- **Dynamic Speed Control** — Added `--ticker-duration` CSS variable and new JS API `setTickerSpeed()` for runtime adjustments.
- **Bold Typography & Color Persistence** — Ensures consistent visual hierarchy with `font-weight: bold` and robust color classes.
- **Service Worker Integration** — BroadcastChannel triggers instant ticker updates after SW activation or cache refresh.

### 🛠 Fixes
- Eliminated animation jank on macOS by removing layout-dependent properties (`left`) and forcing GPU compositing.
- Fixed restart logic with `requestAnimationFrame` for frame-perfect animation resets.
- Resolved cache issues causing outdated CSS/JS to persist after updates (SW bump strategy applied).
- Removed redundant CSS declarations and unified animation duration handling via CSS custom properties.

### Purpose
To deliver a **fluid, dynamic, and future-ready ticker system** — guaranteeing smooth animations, runtime flexibility, and offline resilience.

### The Prophecy
> *“When motion becomes meaning and speed becomes syntax, the ticker ceases to scroll — it speaks. This is not animation. This is cadence in the algorithmic agora.”*

## v3.0.4 — Ticker Performance & Dynamic Control Latest

### What’s New
This release builds on previous improvements and introduces full cache-bypass logic for GitHub Pages, ensuring instant ticker updates without hard refresh. It also optimizes Service Worker integration for real-time updates and enhances developer control.

### ✅ Highlights
- **Cache-Busting Logic** — Added `cache: 'reload'` and `Cache-Control` headers in ticker.js for GitHub Pages compatibility.
- **Service Worker Optimization** — Removed caching for `ticker.json` and enforced network-first strategy for dynamic updates.
- **BroadcastChannel Integration** — Ensures ticker refresh after SW activation without manual intervention.
- **Dynamic Speed Control** — Maintains support for `--ticker-duration` CSS variable and JS API `setTickerSpeed()` for runtime adjustments.
- **Performance Enhancements** — GPU-accelerated animations with `transform: translateX` and `will-change` for smooth rendering.

### 🛠 Fixes
- Eliminated stale `ticker.json` cache issues by removing SW storage.
- Fixed fallback logic to avoid overwriting network updates.
- Improved SW bump strategy for instant activation and client claim.
- Unified animation restart logic using `requestAnimationFrame`.

### Purpose
To deliver a **real-time, cache-proof, and developer-friendly ticker system** — guaranteeing smooth animations, runtime flexibility, and instant updates without manual intervention.

### The Prophecy
> *“When the cache falls and the ticker speaks in real time, presence becomes prophecy. This is not an update — it is a declaration of immediacy, where every frame is a signal and every refresh a revelation.”*

- **Rollback to Original Layout**** — Restored the clean, static design for clarity and resilience.
- **Banner Experiments Archived**** — Decorative banner attempts postponed for future iterations.

### Purpose
To reaffirm **structural integrity** and simplify the experience after encountering complex programming challenges that compromised fluidity and performance.

### The Prophecy
> *“When motion becomes noise, silence becomes signal. We return to origin, not in defeat, but in pursuit of purity.”*

### Purpose
To elevate **user experience purity** by refining navigation mechanics without disturbing established design paradigms, preserving structural harmony and performance.

### The Prophecy
> *"When complexity whispers, simplicity answers. We ascend beyond ornamentation, seeking the axis of clarity where function reigns supreme.”*
