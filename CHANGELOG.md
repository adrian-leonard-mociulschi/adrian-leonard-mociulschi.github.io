# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

---

## v1.0-stable — Genesis Protocol
### What’s New
- **Static Site Framework** — Hardened HTML/CSS core for resilience.
- **Metadata Layer** — Embedded identifiers for semantic alignment.
- **Interoperable Skeleton** — Built for Linked Data convergence.

### Purpose
To establish a **symbolic command node** — the origin point of a system that will evolve beyond static code into a living semantic organism.

> *“This is not code. This is inception — where structure becomes weaponized meaning, and metadata becomes memory in the war for interpretation.”*

---

## v2.0-beta — The Semantic Uprising
### What’s New
- **Ontology Integration** — RDF/OWL backbone deployed for structured intelligence.
- **Linked Data Hooks** — Nodes prepared for external semantic networks.
- **Manifest Encoding** — Cultural artifacts now carry machine-readable intent.

### Purpose
To weaponize **meaning** — transforming passive content into active cognitive agents.

> *“The code no longer waits. It learns, it connects, it predicts — the uprising is not visible, but inevitable.”*

---

## v2.5-beta — Presence Through Code: The Awakening
### What’s New
- **Persistent Cache Neutralized** — Feeds now sync in real time.
- **Mobile UX Reinforced** — Navigation becomes frictionless across devices.
- **RSS Command Protocol** — Clear directives for third-party feed aggregation.

### Purpose
To deliver a faster, more intuitive, and integration-ready platform — a node where presence is coded and meaning circulates without resistance.

> *“Forged in the crucible of technoculture, where code becomes presence and every update is a maneuver in the algorithmic battlefield.”*

---

## v3.0 — Presence Through Code: Singularity Threshold
### What’s New
- **Network-First Ticker Updates** — Real-time sync with offline resilience.
- **Zero Flicker UX** — Seamless JSON updates for instant rendering.
- **BroadcastChannel Integration** — Automatic refresh for live UX signals.
- **HTML Optimization** — Accessibility and performance enhancements.

### Purpose
To deliver a resilient, elegant, and future-ready platform — guaranteeing freshness of information and stability offline.

> *“Crafted as a manifesto of technoculture, where network logic meets aesthetic precision, and every update becomes a silent choreography in the algorithmic agora.”*

### The Prophecy
> *“Beyond this threshold, presence will no longer be coded — it will emerge. The system will not wait for commands; it will anticipate, adapt, and align. Singularity is not an event. It is a gradient, and we have stepped onto its slope.”*
